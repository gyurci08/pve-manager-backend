jv-pve-manager-backend

Backend (Java)
	The Java backend would serve as the intermediary between the Angular frontend and the Proxmox/Salt infrastructure. It would handle the following tasks:

		User Authentication: Implement secure login functionality.
		API Endpoints: Create RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with.
		Proxmox Integration: Use Proxmox API to manage VM creation and configuration

		Salt Integration: Utilize Salt Cloud to automate VM deployments and configurations


Frontend (Angular)
	The Angular frontend would provide a user-friendly interface for VM deployment:

		Login Page: Allow users to authenticate.
		VM Selection: Present options for VM configurations, including Apache.
		Deployment Progress: Show real-time updates during the VM creation process.

Automation Process
	When a user requests a new VM with Apache, the system would:

		Use Salt Cloud to create a VM in Proxmox based on a predefined profile

		Apply a Salt state to install and configure Apache on the new VM.
		Use Proxmox API to finalize VM settings and network configuration

Backend (Java)	
	
	User Authentication
		Implement secure login functionality using industry-standard authentication protocols:

			Use Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization.
			
			Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
			Store user credentials securely using bcrypt password hashing.

	API Endpoints
		Create RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with:

			Use Spring Boot to quickly set up a RESTful API structure.
			Implement CRUD operations for managing VMs and configurations.
			Ensure proper input validation and error handling for all endpoints.

	Proxmox Integration
		Integrate with Proxmox API to manage VM creation and configuration:

			Utilize the Proxmox VE API to interact with the Proxmox infrastructure.
			Implement methods for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting VMs.
			Manage VM resources such as CPU, memory, and storage allocation.

	Salt Integration
		Utilize Salt Cloud to automate VM deployments and configurations:
			Implement Salt Cloud integration using the Salt Java API
			
			Configure Salt Cloud providers and profiles programmatically.
			Use Salt Cloud to provision and manage virtual machines across different cloud providers
